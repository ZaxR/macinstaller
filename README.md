# Mac Installer Script

This script will help set up a new Mac from scratch with the developer in mind. It includes commands/comments to do the following:
* Install Homebrew
* Create a handy alias for brew
* Install GNU core utilities (those that come with OS X are outdated)
* Install new bash (the one that come with OS X is outdated)
* Install and switch to Zsh (a superset of bash)
  * Add basic zsh configuration
  * Add oh-my-zsh, theme, and plugins
* Install basic binaries (this is for developers and will likely need customization)
* Install common basic and productivity applications
* Tweak OS settings
* Notes manual steps for manual installs/configurations

If you notice anything that appears outdated, please message me or submit a pull request.

Enjoy!
